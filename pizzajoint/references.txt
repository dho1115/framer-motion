FRAMER MOTION REFERENCES: 

#ToAninmate(start)
(1) Import motion.
(2) To make anything "animatable", just add "motion." next to the element. Example: <motion.h3></motion.h3>, <motion.div></motion.div>, <motion.p></motion.p>. This will add framer motion animating properties.
(3) Inside the <motion.[component name]></motion.[component name]>, add the following prop: animate={{ fontSize: 50 }}. So, in this example, the fontSize would be animated to 50. So, if the element we want to aninate is, say, a div:
<motion.div animate={{ fontSize: 50 }}></motion.div>
(4) You can add x or y properties inside animate={{ }} to move it left or right: 
animate={{ x: 105 }}.

#Initial.
Allows us to set an INITIAL state from which the element animates. So, when you do:
initial={{x: 15}}
animate={{x: 157}}
15 is where you animate FROM and 157 is where you animate TO.

#animating x:0.
When we say: animate={{x: 0}} we do not mean that the element that animate={{x: 0}} starts at 0. What it actually means is to MOVE x zero (0) positions from where it normally is at.

#type tween.
The animation will not have the "bounce" effect that you would normally see with the default "spring".

#stiffness.
The stiffness property only works with type: "spring". The higher the spring, the more "bounce" it will have. transition={{ type: 'spring', stiffness: 350 }}. Again, you MUST have a type: 'spring'. Default spring is about 100.

#duration.
The transition type {{ duration: 3.5 }} ONLY works on a type: "tween":
transition={{ type: 'tween', duration: 3.5 }}
